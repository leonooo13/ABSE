` python ` 文件可以帮助理解abe的流程

`jar `文件是使用jPBC里面的双线性对的运算，来完成ABE的算法，方案采用的是`CPABE ` and `InvertedIndex`来完成搜索加密，

1. this way with CPABE encodes the key of aes,abe can encode the files of onwers which way is quicky and easy,CPabe also decode the InvertedIndex(W,[f1,f2,f3])
2. the key of this design is how to match the word of owner with the word1 of user
3. how to prove the safety of this program,maby math
## how to use it?
your pc shoud install Java 14(14 is ok in my pc),run it in termainal ` java -jar ABSEUI.jar` 
## about the source code
I will open the code after the report
